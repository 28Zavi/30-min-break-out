# 30-min-break-out
 This project aims to identify trend breaks in the 30-minute timeframe and execute trades in the opposite direction using a mean reversion approach.

The MQL5 Mean Reversion Trading Bot is an expert advisor (EA) designed to automate trading strategies based on mean reversion principles. The EA identifies potential trend breaks on the 30-minute timeframe and executes trades in the opposite direction, aiming to capitalize on price movements reverting to the mean.

**How It Works**
The EA uses the following customizable parameters:

**risk**: Sets the risk percentage per trade.
**SL**: Defines the stop loss distance in points.
**RR**: Determines the reward-to-risk ratio for each trade.
**Ceiling**: The distance in points from the previous high/low, used to identify trade entry conditions.
**BeTriggerPoints**: The distance in points beyond the entry price to trigger the break-even stop loss.
**BePufferPoints**: A buffer in points added to the break-even stop loss level.
**PartialCloseFactor**: The percentage of the position to be closed partially when specific conditions are met.
**PartialClosePointsRR**: The reward-to-risk ratio for partial closure.
